/*Exercise 1:

Make use of the template literal to get the output of the below two variables as “Abhay is a programmer”

var name = "Abhay"; //You can replace your name here.
var vocation = "programmer"; //You can also replace what you do.
console.log() //This is where you can write the code.
*/
var name = "Abhay";
var vocation = "programmer";

console.log(`${name} is a ${vocation}`);


/*
Exercise 2:

You have two numbers, the first, is the original price, the second, is the discounted price.

You need to work out what percentage a user saves if they purchase at the second price.

Original price - 25, 
New price - 10
Output: in console.log()
"You saved X% on this sale"  //You need to calculate the X
//So, in this case your output will be:
"You saved 60% on this sale
